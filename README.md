# MyFirstWebProject
A website designed from scratch using HTML and CSS; Combining Grid modeling, Flexbox, and web-resposive orientation. 

Hey! It's been two months since I started a Full Stack Python development course and this is a bit of what I've learnt so far! 
The challenge in the course was not to use Bootstrap but to build the whole website from 0. So I modeled it using grid and flexbox combined in order to practice a bit of everything.
You will also find animations in the titles, images, and logos, and there are also shortcut links to go to the different sections of the site, as well as to go back to the beginning. 

This took about ten days to build since I can't devote myself 24/7 to coding. Nonetheless, I'm absolutely delighted with the result! Let's go!
